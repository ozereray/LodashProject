Integrate Lodash library for advanced utility functions and optimization

- Added Lodash to the project to simplify and optimize common operations on arrays, objects, and strings.
- Replaced vanilla JavaScript methods with Lodashâ€™s highly optimized functions, improving code performance and readability.
- Key functionalities introduced include:
  - `_.uniq`: Removes duplicate values from arrays, ensuring unique elements.
  - `_.map`: Simplifies the transformation of array elements, making the code more concise and readable.
  - `_.capitalize`: Automatically capitalizes the first letter of strings, streamlining string manipulation tasks.
  - `_.groupBy`: Groups objects in an array based on a specified property, making data organization and processing easier.
- This update reduces the need for custom, repetitive functions and enhances maintainability by utilizing Lodash's battle-tested and well-documented methods.
- The integration of Lodash ensures a more efficient and standardized approach to handling data operations across the project.
